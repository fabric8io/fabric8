   This is the OSGi Blueprint XML file defining the CXF JAX-WS beans.  Because the file is in the
   OSGI-INF/blueprint directory inside our JAR, it will be automatically activated as soon as the artifact is installed.

   The root element for any OSGi Blueprint file is 'blueprint' - you also see the namespace definitions for the Blueprint
   and the CXF Core and JAX-WS namespaces.
-->

      Adding a <cxf:bus/> definition to the Blueprint XML file is optional: it is only required if you want to specify
      some additional configuration for the CXF Bus instance used by the service endpoints defined in this XML file.

    <cxf:bus>
        <!--
           In this example, we're enabling the logging feature.  This will ensure that both the inbound and outbound
           XML message are being logged for every web service invocation.

      Finally, we're configuring the actual JAX-WS endpoint, referring to our web service implementation class and the URI
      address we want to assign to our service.  The address is relative to the CXF servlet URI, with the default configuration
      in place, this endpoint will be available at 'http://localhost:8181/cxf/HelloWorld'.

   This is the OSGi Blueprint XML file defining the Camel context and routes.  Because the file is in the
   OSGI-INF/blueprint directory inside our JAR, it will be automatically activated as soon as the bundle is installed.

   The root element for any OSGi Blueprint file is 'blueprint' - you also see the namespace definitions for both the Blueprint
   and the Camel namespaces.

      The namespace for the camelContext element in Blueprint is 'http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint'.

      While it is not required to assign id's to the <camelContext/> and <route/> elements, it is a good idea
      to set those for runtime management purposes (logging, JMX MBeans, ...)

          A very simple Camel route, that uses a timer to trigger a message every 5 second.

          The <setBody> sets a body into the Camel Message.

          The <log/> elements are used to add human-friendly business logging statements. They make it easier to see what the
          route is doing.

          <from uri="timer:foo?period=5s"/>

                <simple>Hello from Fabric based Camel route!</simple>
            </setBody>
            <log message=">>> ${body} : ${sys.runtime.id}"/>

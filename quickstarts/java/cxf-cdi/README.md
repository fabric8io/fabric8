# REST with CXF and CDI QuickStart

This quick start demonstrates how to create a RESTful (JAX-RS) web service using Apache CXF and expose it using CDI running in a Java standalone container.

The REST service provides a customer service that supports the following operations
 
- PUT /customerservice/customers/ - to create or update a customer
- GET /customerservice/customers/{id} - to view a customer with the given id
- DELETE /customerservice/customers/{id} - to delete a customer with the given id
- GET /customerservice/orders/{orderId} - to view an order with the given id
- GET /customerservice/orders/{orderId}/products/{productId} - to view a specific product on an order with the given id

When the application is deployed, you can access the REST service using a web browser as shown in the screenshot below:

### Building this example

The example comes as source code and pre-built binaries with the fabric8 distribution. 

To try the example you do not need to build from source first. Although building from source allows you to modify the source code, and re-deploy the changes to fabric. See more details on the fabric8 website about the [developer workflow](http://fabric8.io/gitbook/developer.html).

To build from the source code:

1. Change your working directory to `quickstarts/java/cxf-cdi` directory.
1. Run `mvn clean install` to build the quickstart.

After building from the source code, you can upload the changes to the fabric container:

1. It is assumed that you have already created a fabric and are logged into a container called `root`.
1. Change your working directory to `quickstarts/java/cxf-cdi` directory.
1. Run `mvn fabric8:deploy` to upload the quickstart to the fabric container.

If you run the `fabric8:deploy` command for the first then, it will ask you for the username and password to login the fabric container.
And then store this information in the local Maven settings file. You can find more details about this on the fabric8 website about the [Maven Plugin](http://fabric8.io/gitbook/mavenPlugin.html).


## How to run this example

The following information is divided into two sections, whether you are using the command line shell in fabric, or using the web console

### Using the command line shell

You can deploy and run this example at the console command line, as follows:

1. It is assumed that you have already created a fabric and are logged into a container called `root`.
1. Create a new child container and deploy the `quickstarts-java-cxf.cdi` profile in a single step, by entering the
 following command at the console:

        fabric:container-create-child --profile quickstarts-java-cxf.cdi root mychild

1. Wait for the new child container, `mychild`, to start up. Use the `fabric:container-list` command to check the status of the `mychild` container and wait until the `[provision status]` is shown as `success`.


### Using the web console

You can deploy and run this example from the web console, as follows

1. It is assumed that you have already created a fabric and are logged into a container called `root`.
1. Login the web console
1. Click the Wiki button in the navigation bar
1. Select `quickstarts` --> `java` --> `cxf.cdi`
1. Click the `New` button in the top right corner
1. In the Create New Container page, enter `mychild` in the Container Name field, and click the *Create and start container* button


### How to try this example

To use the application be sure to have deployed the quickstart in fabric8 as described above. 

### Access services using a web browser

You can use any browser to perform a HTTP GET.  This allows you to very easily test a few of the RESTful services we defined:

Notice: As fabric8 assigns a free dynamic port to the Java container, the port number may vary on your system.

Use this URL to display the root of the REST service, which also allows to access the WADL of the service:

    http://localhost:8080/cxfcdi

Use this URL to display the XML representation for customer 123:

    http://localhost:8080/cxfcdi/cxfcdi/customerservice/customers/123

You can also access the XML representation for order 223 ...

    http://localhost:8080/rest/cxf/customerservice/orders/223

**Note:** if you use Safari, you will only see the text elements but not the XML tags - you can view the entire document with 'View Source'


### To run a command-line utility:

You can use a command-line utility, such as cURL or wget, to perform the HTTP requests.  We have provided a few files with sample XML representations in `src/test/resources`, so we will use those for testing our services.

1. Open a command prompt and change directory to `cxf-cdi`.
2. Run the following curl commands (curl commands may not be available on all platforms):
    
    * Create a customer
 
            curl -X POST -T src/test/resources/add_customer.xml -H "Content-Type: text/xml" http://localhost:8080/cxfcdi/cxfcdi/customerservice/customers
  
    * Retrieve the customer instance with id 123
    
            curl http://localhost:8080/cxfcdi/cxfcdi/customerservice/customers/123

    * Update the customer instance with id 123
  
            curl -X PUT -T src/test/resources/update_customer.xml -H "Content-Type: text/xml" http://localhost:8080/cxfcdi/cxfcdi/customerservice/customers

    * Delete the customer instance with id 123
  
             curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/cxfcdi/cxfcdi/customerservice/customers/123


## Undeploy this example

The following information is divded into two sections, whether you are using the command line shell in fabric, or using the web console

### Using the command line shell

To stop and undeploy the example in fabric8:

1. Stop and delete the child container by entering the following command at the console:

        fabric:container-stop mychild
        fabric:container-delete mychild

### Using the web console

To stop and undeploy the example in fabric8:

1. In the web console, click the *Runtime* button in the navigation bar.
1. Select the `mychild` container in the *Containers* list, and click the *Stop* button in the top right corner

   This is the OSGi Blueprint XML file defining the CXF JAX-RS beans.  Because the file is in the
   OSGI-INF/blueprint directory inside our JAR, it will be automatically activated as soon as the artifact is installed.

   The root element for any OSGi Blueprint file is 'blueprint' - you also see the namespace definitions for both the Blueprint
   and the CXF JAX-RS namespaces.

      The <jaxrs:server/> element sets up our JAX-RS services.  It defines:
      - the server's address, '/crm', relative to the default CXF servlet URI
        with the default settings, the server will be running on 'http://localhost:8181/cxf/crm'
      - a list of service beans

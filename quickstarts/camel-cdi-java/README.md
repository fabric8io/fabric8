camel-cdi-java: demonstrates using Camel with CDI in the Java Container
=======================================================================

This example shows how to work with Camel in the Java Container using CDI to configure components,
endpoints and beans.

The example consumes messages from a queue and writes them to the file
system.

You will need to compile this example first:
  mvn compile

To run the example type
  mvn camel:run
  
You can see the routing rules by looking at the java code in the
  src/main/java directory

  To stop the example hit ctrl + c
  
When we launch the example using the camel maven plugin, a local CDI container
is created and started.

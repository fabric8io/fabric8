   This is the OSGi Blueprint XML file defining the Camel context and routes.  Because the file is in the
   OSGI-INF/blueprint directory inside our JAR, it will be automatically activated as soon as the artifact is installed.

   The root element for any OSGi Blueprint file is 'blueprint' - you also see the namespace definitions for both the Blueprint
   and the Camel namespaces.

      We are using the OSGi Blueprint XML syntax to define a bean that we use in our Camel route to determine
      the geographical region. The code for this bean can be found in src/main/java/org.jboss.fuse.examples/eip/RegionSupport.java
    -->
    <bean id="MyRegionSupport" class="org.jboss.quickstarts.fuse.eip.RegionSupport" />

    <!--
      The namespace for the camelContext element in Blueprint is 'http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint'. We can also define 
      namespace prefixes we want to use in the XPath expressions in our CBR here.
      
      We defined the namespace prefix order so that we use the namespace from the order messages in the XPath expressions.

      While it is not required to assign id's to the <camelContext/> and <route/> elements, it is a good idea
      to set them for runtime management purposes (logging, JMX MBeans, ...)

          This is the main Camel route.  In Camel, you can split up routes into more manageable bits and pieces and
          using a direct: endpoint to link those routes together again.

          In this case, files will be sent to the direct:splitter endpoint after a wiretap has sent a copy of the message
          to the direct:wiretap endpoint.  The routes behind these endpoints are defined below.
        -->
        <route id="mainRoute">
            <from uri="file:work/eip/input" />
            <log message="[main]    Processing ${file:name}" />
            <wireTap uri="direct:wiretap" />
            <to uri="direct:splitter" />

        </route>

        <!--
          This route starts with the direct:wiretap endpoint we used in our main route.  Whenever the wiretap in the main route
           sends a message to this endpoint, the route below will log a human-friendly message and store a copy
           of the message in the work/eip/archive directory.
        -->
        <route id="wiretapRoute">
            <from uri="direct:wiretap" />

        <!--
          This route starts with the direct:splitter endpoint we used in our main route.  In this route, we will split a file
          containing multiple <order/> elements into separate messages, so we can store the orders in a separate
          directory for every geographical region.

                  We are using XPath to split the message body. The namespace prefix, order, used in the XPath expression was

                  we want to keep the order XML message, but we add two additional pieces of information:
                  - the order id : we use XPath to determine the order id
                  - the geographical region : we are using a method called getRegion() on the MyRegionSupport bean we defined earlier

                  Another human-friendly log message, this time using the extra headers we just added to the message

                <!--
                  A recipient list can be used to dynamically determine the next steps for a message.  In this case, we dynamically
                  generate the file: endpoint uri using the two headers we defined earlier.  We will also send the message to the
                  direct:filter endpoint to see if the order needs attention from our strategic account management team.

   This is the OSGi Blueprint XML file defining the CXF JAX-RS beans.  Because the file is in the
   OSGI-INF/blueprint directory inside our JAR, it will be automatically activated as soon as the artifact is installed.

   The root element for any OSGi Blueprint file is 'blueprint' - you also see the namespace definitions for both the Blueprint
   and the CXF JAX-RS namespaces.

      The <jaxrs:server/> element is used to set up our JAX-RS services.  It defines:
      - the server's address, '/securecrm', relative to the default CXF servlet URI
        with the default settings, the server will be running on 'http://localhost:8181/cxf/securecrm'
      - a list of service beans
        in this example, we refer to another bean defined in this Blueprint XML file with a <ref/> element

       We are using the OSGi Blueprint XML syntax to define a bean that we referred to in our JAX-RS server setup before.
       This bean is a CXF interceptor that ensures that a request has been authenticated before allowing it to pass. For
       performing the authentication, this interceptor will delegate to JAAS, using the realm name 'karaf'.  This will allow
       it to reuse the same authentication mechanism that is being used to secure other ESB facilities, such as the remote
       SSH shell and the webconsole.

RHQ Agent Configuration

This configuration file defines the initial defaults for an agent that is not
yet fully configured.  Once the agent is completely configured (e.g. when
you answer the setup questions asked by the agent when it starts up the
very first time), this configuration file is no longer read or used to define
the agent's behavior.

After you provide the agent the answers to the setup questions, it will store
the configuration in Java Preferences and will thereafter no longer need this
configuration file.  See the Java documentation on the Java Preferences API
for more information as to where the persisted configuration is stored for
your particular platform the agent is running on.

When you start the agent for the very first time it will not yet have any
configuration preferences defined.  It is only under this condition when this
configuration file is actually used automatically by the agent.
Please keep this in mind whenever you make changes to this configuration file
(to be more clear - do not assume that when you change this file that the
agent's configuration will actually change - it normally will not).

If you do want to change the agent's configuration by making changes to this
file, you must tell the agent to re-configure itself with the file by
passing in the command line option "-c agent-configuration.xml".

If you want to fully configure the agent with this configuration file and
not be asked those setup questions (even during the very first time you
start the agent) make sure that you set the configuration preference named
"rhq.agent.configuration-setup-flag" to the value of "true" in this file
(of course, if you do this, you must make sure this configuration file
contains all valid configuration for all settings since you opted not to be
asked the setup questions).

If you are interested in learning about additional ways in which you can
configure the agent, please see the help documentation on the agent prompt
commands named "config", "setconfig" and "setup" and the command line options
-l (cleanconfig), -c (config), -p (prefs), -s (setup) and -a (advanced).

          the agent assumes the configuration is not complete and
          will ask a series of setup questions to the user in order
          to be fully configured.

          If you write your own custom agent configuration file, you
          will probably want to set this flag to true since you
          probably will set all of your configuration right in the
          configuration file itself.  However, you may wish to
          distribute agent configuration files with only a subset
          of configuration preferences set and rely on each agent's

          now know about it.

          This value is only the default if a command has not specified
          its own timeout.  A command can override this by setting its

          not be used for all commands that are sent. If this value is
          less than or equal to 0, there will be no default timeout
          and commands will therefore be allowed to take as long as they
          need (again, this is the default, individual commands may
          override this and set their own timeout).  While this infinite
          timeout default could conceivably cause a thread to hang
          waiting for a rogue command that never finishes, it also reduces

          This is the minimum amount of time, in milliseconds, the client
          sender will wait before trying to resend a guaranteed command
          that previously failed.  This is not a guarantee of when
          a command is retried - all that can be inferred is that a
          command that fails to be sent will not be retried until at
          least this amount of time passes.
          Note: if the sender is currently waiting in this retry pause
          period, the agent will not be able to be shutdown until that
          retry period is over. In other words, if the agent is asked
          to shutdown, it will wait for those commands waiting in this
          retry interval to wake up. This is to help ensure those
          commands are not lost.  Keep this time period short enough
          to make agent shutdowns fairly responsive but long enough
          to avoid spinning the process with continuous resending of
          commands during periods of RHQ Server downtime. It is

          The spool file is where the agent persists commands that
          are flagged for guaranteed delivery and need to be sent.
          The format is defined as "max-file-size:purge-percentage".
          The first number is the size, in bytes, of the maximum file
          size threshold.  If the spool file grows larger than this, a
          "purge" will be triggered in order to shrink the file.
          The second number is the purge percentage which indicates how
          large the file is allowed to be after a purge.  This is
          specified as a percentage of the first parameter - the max
          file size threshold.  For example, if the max file size is
          100000 (i.e. 100KB) and the purge percentage is 90, then when
          the spool file grows larger than 100KB, a purge will be
          triggered and the file will be shrunk to no more than
          90% of 100KB - which is 90KB.  In effect, 10KB will be freed
          to allow room for new commands to be spooled.  When this
          occurs, unused space is freed first and if that does not
          free up enough space, the oldest commands in the spool file
          will be sacrificed in order to make room for the newer
          commands.

          If this flag is true, the commands stored in the spool file
          will be compressed. This can potentially save about 30%-40% in
          disk space (give or take), however, it slows down the
          persistence mechanism considerably. Recommended setting for
          this should be true unless something on the agent deployment

          performance hit will only appear when unusual conditions occur,
          such as shutting down while some guaranteed commands have not

          rhq.agent.client.send-throttling

          If this setting is defined, it will enable send throttling to
          occur while sending commands to the server.  The format is
          defined as "max-commands:quiet-period-milliseconds"
          where the maximum commands defines the maximum number
          of commands that will be sent before the start of a quiet
          period.  The quiet period defines the number of milliseconds
          in which no commands should be sent.  After this duration
          expires, commands can again be sent, up to the maximum defined.
          Note that send throttling only affects those commands that
          are "throttle-able".  Some commands are sent as soon as
          possible, regardless of the throttling settings.

          This affects sending commands synchronously and asynchronously.

          than the maximum number of commands are queued within this
          time period, they will wait until the next burst period starts
          before being able to be dequeued.

          detector.

          The multicast-address is used to broadcast detection messages.
          To be more specific, it is the IP address of the
          multicast group the detector will join.  The bind-address
          is the IP that is bound by the network interface.

          detectors do not send their heartbeat messages within the

          The agent's connector configuration.  This is the service that
          listens for incoming client requests and passes them to the
          appropriate server-side components for processing.  See the
          JBoss/Remoting documentation for a full list of options
          that can be specified.  Note that because this is an XML file,
          you must specify "&amp;" in the transport-params value
          when needing an ampersand to separate the parameters.

          If you do not define the bind-address, the agent will, at
          runtime, pick an address to bind to based on the network
          adapters that are available. If you want the agent to use
          a specific IP or address, then you must define the
          bind-address here.

          Notice about bind-address and bind-port:
          If you use transport param "serverBindAddress", that will
          actually be the address the agent will use to bind its
          socket and the rhq.communications.connector.bind-address
          will be the public address the RHQ Server will use to
          talk to the agent.
          If you use transport param "serverBindPort", that will
          actually be the port the agent will use for its server
          socket and the rhq.communications.connector.bind-port
          will be the public port the RHQ Server will use to
          talk to the agent.

          The maximum amount of milliseconds a remoted stream
          is allowed to be idle before it is automatically closed and
          removed from the server. This means that a client must
          attempt to access the remoted stream every X milliseconds
          (where X is the value of this setting) or that stream will no
          longer be available. Note that this does not mean a client
          must read or write the entire stream in this amount of time,
          it only means a client must make a request on the stream every
          X milliseconds (be it to read or write one byte, see how many
          bytes are available to be read, etc).

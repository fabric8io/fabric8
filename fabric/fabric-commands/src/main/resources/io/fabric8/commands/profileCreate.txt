The new profile is created only for the version you specify (or the current default version). If you want to create a profile for every version, you must invoke fabric:profile-create separately for each version (use fabric:version-list to list all versions).

The newly created profile is initially empty, apart from the settings inherited from the parent profiles. To add settings to the new profile, use the fabric:profile-edit command.

For example, to add the new profile, test, which has the current default version and inherits from the parent profiles, mq and camel, enter the following console command:

fabric:profile-create --parents mq --parents camel test

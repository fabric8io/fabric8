Child containers have the following characteristics:

* Each child container has a parent, so that the child containers form a hierarchy, with the root container as the ultimate ancestor.

* The child starts in a new JVM instance (JVM options can be passed to the new JVM through the --jvm-opts command option).

* A complete set of data directories are created for the child instance, under the <InstallDir>/instances/<ChildName> directory. The <InstallDir>/system directory is shared with the root container.

For example, if you have already created a new fabric (for example, by invoking fabric:create), you could add some child containers to the root container by entering the following command:

karaf@root> fabric:container-create-child root child 3

By default, the new child containers are associated with the profile, default. If you want  to specify the profile explicitly, use the --profile option. For example, to specify the esb profile:

fabric:container-create-child --profile esb root childESB

To associate multiple profiles with a new child container, specify the --profile option multiple times. For example:

fabric:container-create-child --profile esb --profile myApp root childMyApp

Using alternate credentials
---------------------------
Each time a container is created Fabric stores the credentials used to create the container and will reuse them for all lifecycle operations (start, stop, delete).
If the credentials have changed then the updated credentials need to be specified as options.
Each container type (child, ssh, jclouds) uses different kind of credentials, as described below:

Child Containers: Use the JMX credentials of the parent container.
SSH Containers: Use the SSH credentials of the target host.
JClouds Containers: Use the ssh credentials of the instance.

Examples:
fabric:container-stop --user <new jmx user of parent> --password <new jmx password of parent> child1
fabric:container-stop --password <new ssh password of target host> ssh1
fabric:container-stop --password <new ssh password of target host> cloud1

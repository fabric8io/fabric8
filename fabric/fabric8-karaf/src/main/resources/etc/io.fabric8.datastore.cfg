#   git          - for a git based data store, using branches for each version
#   caching-git  - optimized git which has built-in caching
#   zookeeper    - store each version in ZK
#
#type = git
type = caching-git
#type = zookeeper

# how frequently in milliseconds should we push to the master git repo
# using a background job that checks for any manual changes in the local
# git reposiroy that users may push outside from fabric itself.
gitPushInterval = 60000

#gitRemoteUrl=https://github.com/<some user>/<some repo>.git
#gitRemoteUser=<some user>
#gitRemotePassword=<some password>

### Getting Started

* [quickstarts](/fabric/profiles/example/quickstarts) and [examples](/fabric/profiles/example) to get you started using [JBoss Fuse](http://www.jboss.org/products/fuse) and [JBoss A-MQ](http://www.jboss.org/products/amq)
* [jboss](/fabric/profiles/jboss) for the profiles for running various [JBoss Products](http://www.jboss.org/products)
* [mq](/fabric/profiles/mq) for working with [JBoss A-MQ](http://www.jboss.org/products/amq)
* [insight](/fabric/profiles/insight) for adding the collection of logs, metrics or messages using [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) so they can be queried such as with Kibana.

### Other Profiles

* [cloud](/fabric/profiles/cloud) for various profiles for working with [jclouds]() like OpenStack and EC2
* [feature](/fabric/profiles/feature) for various profiles which add code features; useful for making your own profiles (e.g. inheriting from *camel-jms* to add the necessary code features)

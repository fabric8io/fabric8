# Example Camel Wiki

This is the _Hello World_ example for using Camel where the Camel Routes are stored directly inside the Wiki.

Since the Camel route is loaded from the wiki, it can be changed easily via the Management Console (with version history and the ability to revert changed) without needing to perform a code release.

For example you can edit the Camel routes directly in the Management Console and perform <a href="/fabric/profiles/docs/fabric/rollingUpgrade.md">rolling upgrades</a> of the changes across containers in a fabric.

### How to run this example

You can deploy and run this example at the console command line, as follows:

1. It is assumed that you have already created a fabric and are logged into a container called `root`.
1. Create a new child container and deploy the `example-camel-wiki` profile in a single step, by entering the
 following command at the console:

        fabric:container-create-child --profile example-camel-wiki root mychild

1. Wait for the new child container, `mychild`, to start up. Use the `fabric:container-list` command to check the status of the `mychild` container and wait until the `[provision status]` is shown as `success`.
1. Log into the `mychild` container using the `fabric:container-connect` command, as follows:

        fabric:container-connect mychild

1. View the container log using the `log:tail` command as follows:

        log:tail

 You should see some output like the following in the log:

        2013-10-16 12:03:47,403 | INFO  | #3 - timer://foo | fabric-client                    | rg.apache.camel.util.CamelLogger  176 | 113 - org.apache.camel.camel-core - 2.12.0.redhat-610115 | >>> Hello from Fabric based Camel route! : 
        2013-10-16 12:03:52,403 | INFO  | #3 - timer://foo | fabric-client                    | rg.apache.camel.util.CamelLogger  176 | 113 - org.apache.camel.camel-core - 2.12.0.redhat-610115 | >>> Hello from Fabric based Camel route! :

 To escape the log view, type Ctrl-C.
1. Disconnect from the child container by typing Ctrl-D at the console prompt.
1. Delete the child container by entering the following command at the console:

        fabric:container-delete mychild

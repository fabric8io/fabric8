## Guestbook

This example demonstrates how to use a template to generate the shared passwords for an application.

Templates let you parameterize a set of Kubernetes and OpenShift objects all at once, and then **apply** them.

The example is based on the [Kubernetes Guestbook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/examples/guestbook/README.md) - see the Guestbook for more descriptions of how the individual objects work together.

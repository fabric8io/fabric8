Trying out FAB in Karaf
=======================

First you'll need a vanilla 2.2.x Karaf then install Fabric into it along with Camel for the shared-camel samples...

Install Fabric and Camel
------------------------

    features:addUrl mvn:org.fusesource.fabric/fuse-fabric/1.1-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
    features:install fabric-bundle

To install Spring DM support

    features:install spring-dm

Install Camel for shared camel tests...

    features:addurl mvn:org.apache.camel.karaf/apache-camel/2.7.1-fuse-00-39/xml/features
    features:install camel-blueprint

You'll need to make sure you have the Fuse repo on your "org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.repositories" property to be able to install the Fuse camel feature...

Using a plain jar as a FAB
--------------------------

If you want to install a plain jar built using a maven-like tool so it includes a META-INF/services/maven/someGroup/someArtifact/pom.xml inside it with &lt;dependency&gt; for flat dependencies
and &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt; for shared dependencies then just prefix the URL with **fab:**

The following example installs the [fab-sample-camel-blueprint-share sample jar](https://github.com/fusesource/fabric/tree/master/fab/tests/fab-sample-camel-blueprint-share)

    osgi:install fab:mvn:org.fusesource.fabric.fab.tests/fab-sample-camel-blueprint-share/1.1-SNAPSHOT

now start it and you're good to go!

## Website

This project generates the Fuse developer zone at: http://fuse.fusesource.org/ along with the documentation for the Fuse open source project.

We love contributions! :) To work on the documentation & try out patches locally try

    cd website
    mvn jetty:run
    open http://localhost:8080/

Then as you edit the page files in the **src** directory you can hit reload on your browser to see the new content.

How to create releases of Fabric

# Release Steps

Various documentation changes first (which should be done before the release is cut)

* update the **fabric\_website/src/main/webapp/download.page** page for this release
* edit the **fabric\_website/src/main/scala/Website.scala** file and change the **project\_version** values
* blog about the release by creating an entry in **fabric\_website/src/blog/releases** 
* update the changelog.md file, copying and pasting the section the release highlights from the above blog post

If the release is a major release then we need to freeze the current website at fabric.fusesource.org/versions/lastVersion

* in the current last-release branch change the fabric-website/pom.xml and edit the "maven-fabric-plugin" section to list the correct remoteServerUrl to something like...

{pygmentize:: xml}
<remoteServerUrl>dav:http://fusesource.com/forge/dav/\${forge-project-id}/versions/snapshot
<remoteServerUrl/>
{pygmentize}

* add a link to the versions.page to this old version. 

Cutting the release 

* Until [MRELEASE-605](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MRELEASE-605) is resolved you need to ensure that you have defined **release-altGitURL** in your **~/.m2/settings.xml** file like this (where /foo/fabric is where your checkout is)

{pygmentize:: xml}
<settings>
  <profiles> 
    <profile>
      <id>release</id>
      <properties>
        <release-altGitURL>scm:git:file:///foo/fabric</release-altGitURL>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>	
{pygmentize}

* check your repo is clean and you are on master branch
* check that we are using the latest versions of dependencies

{pygmentize:: text}
mvn versions:use-next-releases
mvn versions:update-properties
{pygmentize}

* then review the changes to pom.xml to check they all seem fine. You probably want to rollback the jetty changes to version 8.x, other than that it should be fine. Do a test run to check!
* Verify that the `src/main/resources/license-header.txt` file is still current.
* Check that all the source file license headers are in place:

{pygmentize:: text}
mvn -P license license:check
mvn -P license license:format
{pygmentize}

* then review the changes and check they all seem fine. You may need to add exclusions to the `maven-license-plugin`'s
configuration to ignore some files.
* prepare the release

{pygmentize:: text}
mvn -P release release:prepare 
{pygmentize}

* perform the release

{pygmentize:: text}
mvn -P release release:perform 
{pygmentize}

* open [Nexus Staging](https://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/index.html#staging) and close the Staging release of fabric
* now Promote the closed release
* now you'll need to tidy up your local repo and push changes back to github

{pygmentize:: text}
git rebase --hard
git push --tags
{pygmentize}
  
* update the website (see below on making a branch)
* announce the release on the [mailing list](../community.html)
* drink beers!

## Creating a branch for this release and website changes

If this is a major release...

* create a branch for this new release. For example if you've just done ${project_version} then do this...

{pygmentize:: text}
git co fabric-project-${project_version} -b fabric-${project_version}.x
git push origin fabric-${project_version}.x 
{pygmentize}

* check that this branch generates its website to the main fabric.fusesource.org location, not fabric.fusesource.org/versions/snapshot by updating the relevant line in the Rakefile to...

      remote /forge/dav/#{project_id}

* check that index.page and metainfo have at the correct release number

* edit the [fabric last release VCS Root](http://ci.fusesource.com/teamcity/admin/editVcsRoot.html?cameFromUrl=%2Fteamcity%2Fadmin%2FeditBuildTypeVcsRoots.html%3FbuildTypeId%3Dbt119%26init%3D1&action=editVcsRoot&cameFromTitle=Edit+Build+Configuration&vcsRootId=45&editingScope=editBuildType%3Abt119) so that it uses the new branch you have just created **fabric-project-${project_version}**
* ensure that the master branch has its Rakefile to point to the snapshot area

      remote /forge/dav/#{project_id}/versions/snapshot

* ensure also that index.page has the new snapshot version number in it

* kick off the TeamCity CI build for the [fabric last release](http://ci.fusesource.com/teamcity/viewType.html?buildTypeId=bt119&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv) project
* check the new version appears on the [home page](http://fabric.fusesource.org/)
* you might also want to check that the [central maven repo](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/fabric8/fabric8-karaf/${project_version}/) has sync'd before announcing

What all this means is now that you should be able to amend the [website for the current release](http://fabric.fusesource.org/) using the **fabric-project-${project_version}** branch. You can also document new upcoming features for the next release which go into the **master** branch which should be auto-deployed to the [snapshot website](http://fabric.fusesource.org/versions/snapshot/index.html)

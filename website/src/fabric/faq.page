## Using Fabric

### Why should I use Fabric?

To help provision, configure and manage a number of machines or a public or private cloud of [Apache Karaf](http://karaf.apache.org/), [Apache ServiceMix](http://servicemix.apache.org/) or [Fuse](http://fusesource.com/) installations.

### How do I get started?

Try the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.html) which should get you started nice and quick!


### I can't connect to the fabric registry right after I join a container to it.
When using the [fabric:join](commands/fabric-join.html) command, the container that joins the cluster uses the name of the container **(karaf.name)** system property. Currently, it is to the responsibilty of the user to prevent name clashes.
Such name clashes can have unpredictable side effects and one of them can be, to not being able to connect to the registry. To modify the **(karaf.name)** property you can edit the *etc/system.properties* file under the home of the karaf container.

### Why do I get timeout errors, when adding containers to the ensemble.
There can be a lot of reasons, the most popular of which are:

* There is no network connectivity between memebers of the ensmeble for ports *2181*, *2888*, *3888*.
* The members that you are adding in the ensmeble do not currently have the fabric-agent feature installed.

### Where does the fabric-agent download artifacts from?
Profiles can define a list of maven repositories which can be used by the fabric agent in order to download maven artifacts. The default list of repositories is defined as part of the default profile.
The list of repositories can be modified or overridden by modifying the io.fabric8.agent pid of the default or any other profile respectively.

      fabric:profile-edit --pid io.fabric8.agent/org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.repositories=http://username:password@repohostname myprofile

Please note, that the command above will replace the list of repositories. If you need to add one, then you'll need to specify the existing repositories as a comma separated list.

Before reaching any of the repositories defined in the profile, fabric will lookup the runtime registry and find any fabric-maven-proxy running in the cluster. It will first lookup the maven proxy and then fallback to the repositories, if the maven proxy can't find the artifact.

### How do I add additional remote maven repositories to the fabric-maven-proxy?
There are a lot of cases where a user needs to add additional maven repositories to the fabric-maven-proxy. A common case is adding a nexus repository.
To add additional repositories to the fabric-maven-proxy just add them inside the io.fabric8.maven pid.

Adding a repository to the fabric-maven-proxy:

      config:propappend --pid io.fabric8.maven remoteRepositories ,http://username:password@repohostname myprofile

Replacing the remote repository list of to the fabric-maven-proxy:

      config:propset --pid io.fabric8.maven remoteRepositories http://username:password@repohostname myprofile

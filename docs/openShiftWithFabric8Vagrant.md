## Fabric8 Vagrant Box

We maintain a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) image if you want to run OpenShift easily with Fabric8 on non-Linux platforms.

If you are on a linux box then you might want to [use the Linux instructions](setupOpenShift.html#if-you-are-on-a-linux).

### Create the vagrant image

* first clone the [fabric8 git repository](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8) repository

```
git clone https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8.git
cd fabric8
```

The vagrant image is by default configured with 2 cpu cores and 4gb of memory. It is recommended to not exceed about half of your machineâ€™s resources. In case you have plenty of resources on your machine you can increase the settings, by editing the `Vagrantfile` in the fabric8 project, you just cloned. The settings are defined in the bottom of the file:

```
    v.memory = 4096
    v.cpus = 2
```

* if the settings are okay, then the vagrant image is created and started by:

```
    vagrant up
```

* ... that process takes a little while, as resources needs to be downloaded. 

You should now have a running vagrant image running at IP address `172.28.128.4`.

You can SSH into the vagrant image using

```
    vagrant ssh
```

### Using the OpenShift CLI tools

* download and unpack a [release of OpenShift 0.5.1 or later](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/) for your platform (not for the vagrant image) and add the `openshift`, `osc` and `osadm` executables to your `PATH`
* login to OpenShift

```
osc login --server=https://172.28.128.4:8443
```

During the login procedure OpenShift you should allow access using insecure mode, and when prompted for an username and password type in `admin` (also `admin` as the password).

You should now be able to use the [osc CLI tool](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cli.md) to work with Kubernetes and OpenShift resources:

```
osc get pods
```


### Using OpenShift from your host

On your OS X or Windows box you might want to setup these environment variables to more easily work with OpenShift from your Java code:

```
export KUBERNETES_MASTER=https://172.28.128.4:8443
export KUBERNETES_DOMAIN=vagrant.local
export KUBERNETES_TRUST_CERT=true
sudo route -n add 172.0.0.0/8 172.28.128.4
```

The last command makes it easier to see IP address created on the vagrant box

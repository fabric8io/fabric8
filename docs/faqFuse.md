### Questions on JBoss Fuse 

The upstream fabric8 open source project is now focussed on the 2.x version based on [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/).

JBoss Fuse versions 6.x includes its [own branch of fabric8 1.x](https://github.com/jboss-fuse/fabric8) using Karaf and ZooKeeper.

So for any questions relating to fabric8 inside JBoss Fuse 6.x you are best off using one of these:
 
* [JBoss Fuse Forum](https://developer.jboss.org/en/products/fuse)
* [Red Hat Support](https://access.redhat.com/)

You can also browser the [JIRA for JBoss Fuse](https://issues.jboss.org/projects/ENTESB)

The JBoss Fuse fork of fabric8 1.x is here: https://github.com/jboss-fuse/fabric8

## Run OpenShift V3 using Docker

Probably the easiest way to use OpenShift V3 on your laptop is to use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) since that's the only thing you need to install and often developers already have it.

First you'll need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/), the later the version generally the better it is!

If you fancy starting OpenShift V3 the super-easy way, run this one-liner (after setting some [environment variables](#environment-variables) if youâ€™re running on OS X):

    bash <(curl -sSL https://bit.ly/get-fabric8)

This will start up OpenShift in a Docker container, as well as the Fabric8 console (hawtio).

If you would like to try out a fully-featured installation, including aggregated logs & metrics, you can pass in the `-k` ("kitchen sink") flag:

    bash <(curl -sSL https://bit.ly/get-fabric8) -k

If you want to start from scratch, deleting all previously created Kubernetes containers, you can pass in the `-f` flag:

    bash <(curl -sSL https://bit.ly/get-fabric8) -f

With this configuration, OpenShift will use existing images if they are already present locally. To update all the relevant images to this quickstart installation, you can pass
in the `-u` flag:

    bash <(curl -sSL https://bit.ly/get-fabric8) -u

And of course flags can be combined. To start from scratch & update all images at once:

    bash <(curl -sSL https://bit.ly/get-fabric8) -fku

#### Trouble shooting boot2docker

If you are using OS X or a Mac and using boot2docker then sometimes you might see that boot2docker struggles to see index.docker.io when downloading images due to DNS issues. A [work around](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24060099/docker-failed-to-pull-images-from-registry) is as follows:

    boot2docker ssh
    sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf

Then add this line to the top of the file:

    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    nameserver 8.8.4.4

Then save by typing ":qw" and then type

    sudo /etc/init.d/docker restart
    exit
    boot2docker restart
    boot2docker poweroff
    boot2docker up

Also you probably need to disable TLS if you use boot2docker as follows:

If you are using boot2docker 1.3.1, you should edit /var/lib/boot2docker/profile in boot2docker VM to disable TLS, so that can use 2375 as default DOCKER_HOST port and http connection for local registry.

    boot2docker ssh
    sudo vi /var/lib/boot2docker/profile

and add two lines

    DOCKER_TLS=no
    EXTRA_ARGS="--insecure-registry 192.168.59.103:5000 --insecure-registry 172.121.17.4:5000"


### Environment variables

You'll need the following environment variables to be able use the [Tools](http://fabric8.io/v2/tools.html) such as the [Console](console.html), [Maven Plugin](http://fabric8.io/v2/mavenPlugin.html), the [Forge Addons](http://fabric8.io/v2/forge.html) and the [java libraries](javaLibraries.html):

    export DOCKER_IP=`boot2docker ip 2> /dev/null`
    export DOCKER_REGISTRY=$DOCKER_IP:5000
    export KUBERNETES_MASTER=http://$DOCKER_IP:8080
    export FABRIC8_CONSOLE=http://$DOCKER_IP:8484/hawtio

Usually your $DOCKER_IP is something like **192.168.59.103** if you are on Windows or a Mac and are using boot2docker.

### Using the kube command line

Run this command or add it to your ~/.bashrc

    alias kube="docker run --rm --net=host -i -e KUBERNETES_MASTER=http://$DOCKER_IP:8080 openshift/origin:latest cli"

You can now use the kube command line to list pods, replication controllers and services; delete or create resources etc:

    kube get pods
    kube get replicationControllers
    kube get services

To see all the available commands:

    kube --help

**Note** that since we are using docker and you are typically running the docker commands from the host machine (your laptop), the kube command which runs in a linux container (which on Windows or a Mac is inside the boot2docker VM) it won't be able to access local files by file name when supplying -c to apply.

However you can pipe them into the command line via

    cat mything.json | kube apply -f -

### Network routes

To be able to connect to the pod or service IPs inside OpenShift (so that hawtio can connect into your JVMs) these routes will need to be defined on your machine:

    sudo route -n add 172.17.0.0/24 $DOCKER_IP
    sudo route -n add 172.121.17.0/24 $DOCKER_IP

The above single install script will add these automatically for you.

### Running OpenShift

    docker pull openshift/origin
    docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --net=host --privileged openshift/origin start

You should now be able to access the REST API for OpenShift on the **DOCKER_IP** address at [http://192.168.59.103:8080/api/v1beta1/pods](http://192.168.59.103:8080/api/v1beta1/pods)

### Running a local docker registry

    docker run -p 5000:5000 registry

There's a handy script called  [ping-registry.sh](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/blob/master/bin/ping-registry.sh) which will check that you have your **DOCKER_REGISTRY** environment variable setup correctly to point to a valid docker registry so that you can create and push docker images:

    ping-registry.sh

### Running a hawtio console

    docker run -p 8484:8080 -it -e KUBERNETES_MASTER=http://$DOCKER_IP:8080 fabric8/hawtio

You can now access the web console at [http://192.168.59.103:8484/hawtio/kubernetes/pods](http://192.168.59.103:8484/hawtio/kubernetes/pods).

If you have setup the **dockerhost** alias in your /etc/hosts as described below you can use the simpler URL [http://dockerhost:8484/hawtio/](http://dockerhost:8484/hawtio/)

### Docker configuration if you are using a Mac, Windows or other platforms

Here are some tips on how to setup docker on your machine.

First we recommend you upgrade your boot2docker image so it's the latest greatest.

    boot2docker download
    boot2docker up

If you are not on linux [this article](http://viget.com/extend/how-to-use-docker-on-os-x-the-missing-guide) describes how it's a good idea to define **dockerhost** to point to your boot2docker ip address via:

    echo $(docker-ip) dockerhost | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

Then you can access the REST API for OpenShift on the easier to remember and type URL: [http://dockerhost:8080/api/v1beta1/pods](http://dockerhost:8080/api/v1beta1/pods)

### Example

The following example shows you how to build and push a docker image to Kubernetes and deploy it and then use it.

Make sure you have followed the [Get Started Guide](http://fabric8.io/guide/getStarted.html) so you should have things running.

You should be able to check if the docker registry is running OK via this command (which should return an empty json response '{}'):

    curl http://$DOCKER_REGISTRY/v2/

Or you can use the [ping-registry.sh](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/blob/master/bin/ping-registry.sh) script which will check that you have your **DOCKER_REGISTRY** environment variable setup correctly to point to a valid docker registry:

    ping-registry.sh

If either of those return **{}** you are ready to build a quickstart!

#### Build the camel-servlet web application

From the distribution or source code perform these commands to push the docker image:

    git clone https://github.com/fabric8io/quickstarts.git
    cd quickstarts

Now let's navigate to the specific quickstart:

    cd quickstarts/war/camel-servlet
    mvn clean install docker:build
    docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY/fabric8/quickstart-war-camel-servlet:2.2-SNAPSHOT

Now let's deploy the image into the Kubernetes environment:

    mvn fabric8:run

You should now be able to view the quickstart in the fabric8 console.  On the Services tab you will see the camel-servlet URL which will take you to the running example.

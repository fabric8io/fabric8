## Quickstarts

Quickstarts are a collection of examples to get you started deploying and running applications with Fabric8.

The fastest way to get started is to try [deploy an example project](http://fabric8.io/v2/example.html) using the maven plugin

Each QuickStart is documented as follows:

1. A brief description of the example
1. System requirements
1. How to build the example
1. How to run the example either using the command line or using the web console
1. How to try the example
1. How to uninstall the example
1. Optional suggested readings

The quickstarts are categorized accordingly to the container being used:

* [java](https://github.com/fabric8io/quickstarts/tree/master/quickstarts/java) - examples for standalone Java applications
* [karaf](https://github.com/fabric8io/quickstarts/tree/master/quickstarts/karaf) - many examples for Apache Karaf containers (OSGi)
* [spring.boot](https://github.com/fabric8io/quickstarts/tree/master/quickstarts/spring-boot) - examples for using Spring Boot
* [war](https://github.com/fabric8io/quickstarts/tree/master/quickstarts/war) - examples as WAR deployment which can run on containers such as Apache Tomcat, Jetty, and WildFly

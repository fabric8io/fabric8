## Getting Started

#### OpenShift / Kubernetes setup

First you need an OpenShift or Kubernetes environment, which can be setup in multiple ways. For a quick start choose one of these recipes:

* [**Vagrant**](vagrant.html) - OpenShift Origin

  This is the easiest and fastest way to get started with fabric8 locally.
  All you need is [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed locally.
  The detailed steps are described in "[Fabric8 Vagrant Image](vagrant.html)"

* [**Native OpenShift**](openshift.html) - OpenShift Origin

  If you have [OpenShift V3](http://www.openshift.com) installed locally, this [guide](openshift.html) helps you step-by-step how to install fabric8 on it.

* [**Google Container Engine**](gke.html) - Kubernetes

  [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/) (GKE) is a Google hosted Kubernetes platform. There are many other ways to install Kubernetes as listed on the Kubernetes [Getting Started](http://kubernetes.io/gettingstarted/) page however if you want to get up and running quickly without having to setup infrastructure and run through installations then GKE is a great option.  This [guide](gke.html) will help you step-by-step install fabric8 using vanilla Kubernetes hosted on GKE.


#### Local client setup

For a smooth developer experience and for using the fabric8 [tools](../tools.html) a local OpenShift client needs to be setup.
How this is done is described in this [recipe](local.html).

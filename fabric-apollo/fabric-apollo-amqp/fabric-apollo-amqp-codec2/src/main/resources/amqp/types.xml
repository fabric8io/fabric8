  <section name="types" title="Type System" label="AMQP Type System">
    <doc>
      <p>
        The AMQP type system defines a set of commonly used primitive types used for interoperable
        data representation. AMQP values may be annotated with additional semantic information
        beyond that associated with the primitive type. This allows for the association of an AMQP
        value with an external type that is not present as an AMQP primitive. For example, a URL is
        commonly represented as a string, however not all strings are valid URLs, and many
        programming languages and/or applications define a specific type to represent URLs. The AMQP
        type system would allow for the definition of a code with which to annotate strings when the
        value is intended to represent a URL.
      </p>
    </doc>

    <doc title="Primitive Types">
      <p>
        The following primitive types are defined:
      </p>

      <!--TypeListTable-->
    </doc>

    <doc title="Decoding Primitive Types">
      <p>
        For any given programming language there may not be a direct equivalence between the
        available native language types and the AMQP types. The list of mappings between AMQP types
        and programming language types can be found here:
        <xref type="extern" name="http://www.amqp.org/specification/1.0/type-language-mappings"/>
      </p>
    </doc>

    <doc title="Described Types">
      <p>
        The primitive types defined by AMQP can directly represent many of the basic types present
        in most popular programming languages, and therefore may be trivially used to exchange basic
        data. In practice, however, even the simplest applications have their own set of custom
        types used to model concepts within the application's domain, and, for messaging
        applications, these custom types need to be externalized for transmission.
      </p>

      <p>
        AMQP provides a means to do this by allowing any AMQP type to be annotated with
        a <i>descriptor</i>. A <i>descriptor</i> forms an association between a custom type, and an
        AMQP type. This association indicates that the AMQP type is actually a <i>representation</i>
        of the custom type. The resulting combination of the AMQP type and its descriptor is
        referred to as a <i>described type</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A described type contains two distinct kinds of type information. It identifies both an AMQP
        type and a custom type (as well as the relationship between them), and so can be understood
        at two different levels. An application with intimate knowledge of a given domain can
        understand described types as the custom types they represent, thereby decoding and
        processing them according to the complete semantics of the domain. An application with no
        intimate knowledge can still understand the described types as AMQP types, decoding and
        processing them as such.
      </p>
    </doc>

    <doc title="Descriptor Values">
      <p>
        Descriptor values other than symbolic (<xref name="symbol"/>) or numeric
        (<xref name="ulong"/>) are, while not syntactically invalid, reserved - this includes
        numeric types other than <xref name="ulong"/>. To allow for users of the type system to
        define their own descriptors without collision of descriptor values, an assignment policy
        for symbolic and numeric descriptors is given below.
       </p>

       <p>
        The namespace for both symbolic and numeric descriptors is divided into distinct domains.
        Each domain has a defined symbol and/or 4 byte numeric id assigned by the AMQP working
        group. Descriptors are then assigned within each domain according to the following rules:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>symbolic descriptors</dt>
        <dd>
          <p><i>&lt;domain&gt;</i><b>:</b><i>&lt;name&gt;</i></p>
        </dd>

        <dt>numeric descriptors</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            (<i>domain-id</i> &lt;&lt; 32) | <i>descriptor-id</i>

      <p>
        An AMQP encoded data stream consists of untyped bytes with embedded constructors. The
        embedded constructor indicates how to interpret the untyped bytes that follow. Constructors
        can be thought of as functions that consume untyped bytes from an open ended byte stream and
        construct a typed value. An AMQP encoded data stream always begins with a constructor.

      <p>
        An AMQP constructor consists of either a primitive format code, or a described format code.
        A primitive format code is a constructor for an AMQP primitive type. A described format code
        consists of a descriptor and a primitive format-code. A descriptor defines how to produce a
        domain specific type from an AMQP primitive value.

        Format codes map to one of four different categories: fixed width, variable width, compound
        and array. Values encoded within each category share the same basic structure parameterized
        by width. The subcategory within a format-code identifies both the category and width.

  <section name="composite-types" title="Composite Types"
           label="composite type notation and encoding">
    <doc>
      <p>
        AMQP defines a number of <i>composite types</i> used for encoding structured data such as
        frame bodies. A composite type describes a composite value where each constituent value is
        identified by a well known named <i>field</i>. Each composite type definition includes an
        ordered sequence of fields, each with a specified name, type, and multiplicity. Composite
        type definitions also include one or more descriptors (symbolic and/or numeric) for
        identifying their defined representations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Composite types are formally defined in the XML documents included with the specification.
        The following notation is used to define them:
      </p>

      <picture title="Example Composite Type"><![CDATA[
<type class="composite" name="book" label="example composite type">
  <doc>
    <p>An example composite type.</p>
  </doc>

  <descriptor name="example:book:list" code="0x00000003:0x00000002"/>

  <field name="title" type="string" mandatory="true" label="title of the book"/>

  <field name="authors" type="string" multiple="true"/>

  <field name="isbn" type="string" label="the isbn code for the book"/>
</type>
]]>
      </picture>

      <p>
        The <i>mandatory</i> attribute of a field description controls whether a null element value
        is permitted in the representation. The <i>multiple</i> attribute of a field description
        controls whether multiple element values are permitted in the representation. A single
        element of the type specified in the field description is always permitted, as is a null
        element value. Multiple values are represented by the use of an array where the type of the
        elements in the array is the type defined in the field definition.  Note that a null value
        and a zero-length array (with a correct type for its elements) both describe an absence of a
        value and should be treated as semantically identical. A field which is defined as both
        multiple and mandatory MUST contain at least one value (i.e. for such a field both
        <i>null</i> and an array with no entries are invalid).
      </p>

      <p>
        AMQP composite types may be encoded either as a described list or a described map. In
        general a specific composite type definition will allow for only one encoding option. This
        is currently indicated by the naming convention of the symbolic descriptor. Map encodings
        have symbolic descriptors ending in ":map", and list encodings in ":list". (Note that there
        may be a more formal way of distinguishing in a future revision.)
      </p>
    </doc>

    <doc title="List Encoding">
      <p>
        When encoding AMQP composite values as a described list, each element in the list is
        positionally correlated with the fields listed in the composite type definition. The
        permitted element values are determined by the type specification and multiplicity of the
        corresponding field definitions. When the trailing elements of the list representation are
        null, they MAY be omitted. The descriptor of the list indicates the specific composite type
        being represented.
      </p>

      <p>
        The described list shown below is an example composite value of the <i>book</i> type defined
        above. A trailing null element corresponding to the absence of an isbn value is depicted in
        the example, but may optionally be omitted according to the encoding rules.

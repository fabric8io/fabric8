  <section name="security-layers" title="Security Layers" label="Security Layers">
    <doc>
      <p>
        Security Layers are used to establish an authenticated and/or encrypted transport over which
        regular AMQP traffic can be tunneled. Security Layers may be tunneled over one another (for
        instance a Security Layer used by the peers to do authentication may be tunneled over a
        Security Layer established for encryption purposes).
      </p>

      <p>
        The framing and protocol definitions for security layers are expected to be defined
        externally to the AMQP specification as in the case of TLS. An exception to this is the SASL
        security layer which depends on its host protocol to provide framing. Because of this we
        define the frames necessary for SASL to function in the <xref name="sasl"/> section below.
        When a security layer terminates (either before or after a secure tunnel is established),
        the TCP Connection MUST be closed by first shutting down the outgoing stream and then
        reading the incoming stream until it is terminated.

  <section name="tls" title="TLS" label="TLS Security Layer">
    <doc>
      <p>
        To establish a TLS tunnel, each peer MUST start by sending a protocol header. The protocol
        header consists of the upper case ASCII letters "AMQP" followed by a protocol id of two,
        followed by three unsigned bytes representing the major, minor, and revision of the
        specification version (currently <xref name="MAJOR"/>, <xref name="MINOR"/>,
        <xref name="REVISION"/>). In total this is an 8-octet sequence:

      </picture>

      <p>
        Other than using a protocol id of two, the exchange of TLS tunnel headers follows the same
        rules specified in the version negotiation section of the transport specification (See
        <xref name="version-negotiation"/>).

      <p>
        When the use of the TLS Security Layer is negotiated, the following rules apply:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The TLS client peer and TLS server peer are determined by the TCP client peer and TCP
            server peer respectively.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The TLS client peer SHOULD use the server name indication extension as described in
            RFC-4366. If it does so, then it is implementation-specific what happens if this
            differs to hostname in the <xref type="type" name="sasl-init"/> and
            <xref type="type" name="open"/> frame frames.
          </p>
          <p>
            This field can be used by AMQP proxies to determine the correct back-end service to
            connect the client to, and to determine the domain to validate the client's
            credentials against if TLS client certificates are being used.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The TLS client MUST validate the certificate presented by the TLS server.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </doc>

    <doc title="Alternative Establishment">
      <p>
        In certain situations, such as connecting through firewalls, it may not be possible to
        establish a TLS security layer using tunnelling. This might be because a deep packet
        inspecting firewall sees the first few bytes of the connection 'as not being TLS'.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an alternative, implementations MAY run a pure TLS server, i.e., one that does not
        expect the tunnel negotiation handshake. The IANA service name for this is amqps and the
        port is <xref name="SECURE-PORT"/> (5671). Implementations may also choose to run this pure
        TLS server on other ports, should this be operationally required (e.g. to tunnel through a
        legacy firewall that only expects TLS traffic on port 443).

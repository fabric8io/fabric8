## MQ Client

This library provides the **io.fabric8.mq.core.MQConnectionFactory** class which is a JMS ConnectionFactory which connects to ActiveMQ using the [Kubernetes Service]http://fabric8.io/guide/(services.html) discovery mechanism described.

Just create the MQConnectionFactory and it will use the environment variables of the current process to discover the ActiveMQ brokers.

For more information check out the [Fabric8 MQ documentation](http://fabric8.io/guide/fabric8MQ.html)

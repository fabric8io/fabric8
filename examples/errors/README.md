errors: Exception Handling in Camel
===================================
Author: Fuse Team
Level: Beginner
Technologies: Fuse, OSGi, Camel
Summary: Demonstrates Exception handling in Camel
Target Product: Fuse
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-fuse/fuse/>

Overview
---------

This example demonstrates how to handle exceptions that occur while routing messages with Camel.

This example show you how to add a default error handler to your Camel context for all uncaught exceptions. Additionally, it will show you how to add exception handling routines for dealing with specific exception types.

What You Will Learn
--------------------

In studying this example you will learn:

* how to define a Camel route using the Blueprint XML syntax
* how to build and deploy a Fuse Application Bundle (FAB) in JBoss Fuse
* how to define a default error handler to your Camel context
* how to define exception-specific error handling routines

Prerequisites
--------------

Before building and running this example you need:

* Maven 3.0.3 or higher
* JDK 1.6 or 1.7
* JBoss Fuse 6

Files in the Example
--------------------

* `pom.xml` - the Maven POM file for building the example
* `src/main/java/org.jboss.quickstarts.fuse/errors/OrderService.java` - a Java class used to validate the orders being processed by the route. It generates exceptions when an order is placed on a Sunday and also at random intervals.
* `src/main/java/org.jboss.quickstarts.fuse/errors/OrderValidationException.java` - a Java class defining the exception thrown when an order is invalid
* `src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint/errors.xml` - the OSGI Blueprint file that defines the route
* `src/main/resources/data/*.xml` - data files that can be used to test the example
* `src/test/java/org.jboss.quickstarts.fuse/errors/OrderServiceTest.java` - a JUnit test class
* `src/test/resources/log4j.properties` - configuration for formatting the test output

Building the Example
--------------------

To build the example:

1. Change your working directory to the `examples/errors` directory.
2. Run `mvn clean install` to build the example.

Running the Example
-------------------

To run the example:

1. Start JBoss Fuse 6 by running bin/fuse (on Linux) or bin\fuse.bat (on Windows).
2. In the JBoss Fuse console, enter the following command:
        osgi:install -s fab:mvn:org.jboss.quickstarts.fuse/errors/${project.version}
3. As soon as the Camel route has been started, you will see a directory `work/errors/input` in your JBoss Fuse installation.
4. Copy the file you find in this example's `src/test/data` directory to the newly created `work/errors/input` directory.
5. Wait a few moment and you will find the files in directories under `work/errors`:
** `order4.xml` will always end up in the `work/errors/validation` directory
** other files will end up in `work/errors/done` or `work/errors/deadletter` depending on the runtime exceptions that occur
6. Use `log:display` to check out the business logging - the exact output may look differently because the 'unexpected runtime exception...' happen randomly
        Processing order4.xml
        Order validation failure: order date 2012-03-04 should not be a Sunday
        Validation failed for order4.xml - moving the file to work/errors/validation
        Processing order5.xml
        An unexcepted runtime exception occurred while processing order5.xml
        Done processing order5.xml
        ...

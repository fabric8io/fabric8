Summary: Demonstrates how to use the content-based router (CBR)  
Target Product: Fuse  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-fuse/quickstarts>



What is it?
-----------

This quick start shows how to use Apache Camel, and its OSGi integration to dynamically route messages to new or updated OSGi bundles. This allows you to route to newly deployed services at runtime without impacting running services.

This quick start combines use of the Camel Recipient List, which allows you to at runtime specify the Camel Endpoint to route to, and use of the Camel VM Component, which provides a SEDA queue that can be accessed from different OSGi bundles running in the same Java virtual machine.

In studying this quick start you will learn:

* how to define a Camel route using the Blueprint XML syntax
* how to build and deploy a Fuse Application Bundle (FAB) in JBoss Fuse
* how to use the CBR enterprise integration pattern

For more information see:

* http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ContentBasedRouter.html for more information about the CBR EIP
* https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/JBoss_Fuse/ for more information about using JBoss Fuse

Note: Extra steps, like use of Camel VM Component, need to be taken when accessing Camel Routes in different Camel Contexts, and in different OSGi bundles, as you are dealing with classes in different ClassLoaders.


System requirements
-------------------

Before building and running this quick start you need:

* Maven 3.0.3 or higher
* JDK 1.6 or 1.7
* JBoss Fuse 6


Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------

1. Change your working directory to `cbr` directory.
* Run `mvn clean install` to build the quickstart.
* Start JBoss Fuse 6 by running bin/fuse (on Linux) or bin\fuse.bat (on Windows).
* In the JBoss Fuse console, enter the following command:

        osgi:install -s fab:mvn:org.jboss.quickstarts.fuse/cbr/<project version>

* Fuse should give you an id when the bundle is deployed

* You can check that everything is ok by issuing  the command:

        osgi:list
   your bundle should be present at the end of the list


Use the bundle
---------------------

To use the application be sure to have deployed the quickstart in Fuse as described above. 

1. As soon as the Camel route has been started, you will see a directory `work/cbr/input` in your JBoss Fuse installation.
2. Copy the files you find in this quick start's `src/main/resources/data` directory to the newly created `work/cbr/input`
directory.
3. Wait a few moments and you will find the same files organized by country under the `work/cbr/output` directory.
  * `order1.xml` in `work/cbr/output/others`
  * `order2.xml` and `order4.xml` in `work/cbr/output/uk`
  * `order3.xml` and `order5.xml` in `work/cbr/output/us`
4. Use `log:display` to check out the business logging.
        Receiving order order1.xml
        Sending order order1.xml to another country
        Done processing order1.xml


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

To stop and undeploy the bundle in Fuse:

1. Enter `osgi:list` command to retrieve your bundle id
2. To stop and uninstall the bundle enter

        osgi:uninstall <id>

# The values below can be used to configure the thread pool size for NMR endpoints.
# - corePoolSize defines the core thread pool size (default is 4)
# - maximumPoolSize defines the maximum thread pool size, -1 means an unbounded thread pool size (default is -1)
# - queueSize defines the executor queue size (default is 1024)
# - allowCoreThreadTimeOut allows the core threads to timeout (defaults to true)
# - keepAliveTime is the amount of milliseconds a thread is kept alive when idle (defaults to 60000)
#
# Endpoints are provided a ThreadPool with specific configuration.  If no configuration
# can be found for the endpoint name, the default one can be used.
# A given thread pool can be configured by prefixing the above properties with the name followed by a dot.
# For example:
#   foo.bar.corePoolSize=16
#
corePoolSize=4
maximumPoolSize=-1
queueSize=1024
allowCoreThreadTimeOut=true
keepAliveTime=60000
